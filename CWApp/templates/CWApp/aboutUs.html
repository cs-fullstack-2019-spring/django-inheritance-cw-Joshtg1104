    <h3>WHAT WE'RE DOING</h3>
    <p>We are changing Memphis with programs that focus on ensuring that students are taught the principles of information and computation,</p>
    <p>how digital systems work, and they learn how to put this knowledge to use through programming and software development concepts.</p>
    <p>CodeCrew programming includes a number of summer camps, after school programs, in-school electives classes, internships and special events.</p>
    â€‹
    <p>Since May 2015, we have taught more than 1,000 students to code through our summer camps, after school programs, in-school electives, and special events.</p>
    <p>Of the 250 kids we serve weekly, 91% are black and latinx youth, 41% are girls who code, and overall, 89% of our students are more likely to study computer science.</p>
